2008-12-23:
===========
- check_netappfiler_netsnmp.py
  + Experimental snmpwalk implementation
    * Delete lines 237&238 of Debian's libsnmp-python in
      /usr/share/pycentral/libsnmp-python/site-packages/netsnmp/client.py
      or your "client.py" - prints silly debugging information
  + New subsystem "cp" (consistency points) for stats&graphing
- PNP: template added for "cp"

===========
- New subsystem "cacheage", added to testall*

===========
- Added some caching (with "shelve") for FSIDs
  + "--cache FILENAME" option added
  + Reduce SNMPGETs on target, (much) faster now!!1!

  + Use one cache file per host, e.g.:
    ... --cache /var/tmp/nafscache_$HOSTADDRESS$ ...

2008-11-21:
===========
- Some code cleanup
- New subsystem "vol"
  + More accurate check of volume incl. snapshot
  + Same parameter as "fs", see testall*.s
  + You *must* provide "-w" and "-c"!
  + PNP-Template (colors WILL change in the future)
- New "plugin": check_netappfiler_netsnmp.py
  You need the Python bindings of net-snmp!
  Debian: Use Lenny or ...
          deb http://people.teamix.net/~svelt/debian/etch/net-snmp/ ./
          in /etc/apt/sources.list for Etch

  + just use SNMP v2c or v3 - if you have ONTAP 7.3 :-)
